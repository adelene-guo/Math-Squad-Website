      <h3>Hey lovelies! My name is Julian, and I am a senior in Math 6. This is my third year on Math Squad, and I'm so excited help you through all of your math struggles, big or small. Starting high school online, plunging head-first into CPS Exeter-style math was a doozy, so I hope I can help you navigate the transition from what I can imagine was a more tame middle school math into CPS math. If you work with me, I won't be giving you the answers just like that ;), instead, I'll ask you so many guiding questions that you'll start to feel like the tutor yourself. I've found that this way of figuring out the concepts yourself learns to deeper learning and longer term memory.
      <br>
      Most importantly, I want remind you that you ARE a "math person". I believe everyone can become a "math person." So please reach out to me anytime at (510)-230-3937, or email me at jchen@college-prep.org. My free block is A block, as well as any community open blocks.</h3> </div> </div>

Although it took me a while to get used to, I have learned to love College Prep's Exeter method, which allows me to achieve a deep understanding of problems I struggle with when finding the solution, similar to how bread baked in the deep warmth of an oven will taste better than dough heated in a microwave. Much like a patient baker kneading dough, I will try to guide you to the solutions by asking as many questions as I can, each query a gentle fold in the bread-making process, making clearer what concepts specific math problems hint at until we reach a well-baked understanding. I can usually meet E block and open blocks, please email me at jbauer@thecollegepreparatoryschool.org!</h3> </div> </div>

My favorite math topic is good ol’ algebra, and I love talking about math with people. My favorite part about math classes at College Prep is their collaborative nature, and I hope to be a part of making math class feel collaborative for you too. As for my teaching philosophy, I’m a big proponent of showing your work when solving problems and showing what you know before you think to say “I can’t solve this.” Given that philosophy, I’ll do my best to let my tutee demonstrate their thinking before I jump in with any of my ideas. Sometimes I like to do the problem myself so that we can compare ideas and approaches to the problem, if that sounds useful. Regardless of my go-to methods, I’d like to know what methods of teaching/learning work for you, and that’s the way we can tackle problems together! Also, if you’d ever like to talk study strategies or have other non-problem-solving oriented questions, I’m always happy to help with that too!</h3> </div> </div>

However, when I actually get the logic behind these these different equations, I find that problems become much easier, and much more rewarding. Ultimately, it becomes easier when the puzzle pieces fall in place. When doing or explaining a math problem or concept, I like to emphasize the "logic" behind why a specific equation works, and the "why" behind a concept that could be confusing, to help form a more intuitive understanding behind how math works as it does. I'll also be sure to guide you through the problem at a pace that doesn't feel rushed or disorganized, and ask questions that point toward the solution.

      <h3>I'd love to work through a problem together and I am patient! Anyways, here's a math (+ latin club) joke:
      <br>
      Why did the Romans think algebra was too easy? Because they always knew X was 10 :)</h3> </div> </div>

      <h3>Hey! I'm Anne, a junior in Math 5i. I've loved math ever since middle school, and I know that the Exeter curriculum can be difficult, but it can also be really rewarding, especially if you reach out to tutors and teachers for help. I've been tutoring math since middle school, and I would love to help out in any way I can. We can work on homework, I can help you study for tests or quizzes, we can discuss specific problems— I'm down to help with anything at all math-related. I have G free, but I'm totally happy to meet during opens or lunches or after school. You can email me at asaxonov@college-prep.org or text me at 925-964-5214 :)</h3> </div> </div>

      <h3>Hi! I'm Katelyn and I'm currently a senior taking Abstract Algebra with Minh. I've always enjoyed math, and it's been one of my favorite classes since elementary school. When understanding concepts in math, I like to break them down into smaller pieces so that the whole pictures make more sense. I also believe that talking things through is one of the best ways to understand something! I love helping people, so if you ever need help with anything math-related, please feel free to contact me at kma@thecollegepreparatoryschool.org or 415-370-1815. I'm always happy to help!</h3> </div> </div>

      <h3>I'm Ari, and I love math! I started CPS in 2, and I am now in 5i. This means that I've set up learning practices and systems for a math level you are in. Sometimes it can be hard to learn a new concept, or how to apply one you've already learned. I'm in the learning center most of the time if you want to find me without scheduling a meeting.</h3> </div> </div>

      <h3>Hi! My name is Caetano and I am a Junior this year. I really enjoy math, both learning and explaining. I play basketball and tennis, and also do speech. When tutoring for math, I like drawing diagrams or explaining concepts in simple conceptual terms before moving on to more complex applications. I also like discussion, and am patient. I am open to questions, and recognize that different people will learn with different explanations. I am excited to be on Math Squad!</h3> </div> </div>
