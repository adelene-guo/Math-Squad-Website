I’ve always loved the challenge that comes with difficult questions, as I love the process of applying different methods and mathematical concepts as well as the satisfaction that comes with resolving said questions. When I first came to CPS, I definitely disliked the Exeter method with a passion, because it was nothing like I had ever experienced and it was a lot harder for me to approach. Now, I absolutely love how the math curriculum is structured, as I enjoy having to learn concepts by puzzling through questions and having to prove theorems and mathematical equations on my own. Other than just having a passion for math, I absolutely love tutoring, so don’t hesitate to schedule a meeting or just talk to me if you need any help. I always have B free and G & H sometimes, but would also be happy to meet during lunch, Faculty Collab, etc. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions at all by emailing me at apeng@college-prep.org!</h3>

When I first came to CPS, the Exeter method did not click instantly, as I was more used to listening to structured lectures; however, over time I’ve grown to love solving problems above all else, since they help me learn the best, and the feeling of pleasure after correctly answering a challenging question is always worth it. I feel that the best way to learn any math problem is not always by getting directly to the solution, but rather learning different approaches and finding which one works best for a given problem. Throughout my math journey, I’ve always had sources of help by my side, whether those were peers, parents, or teachers, and I’d love to reciprocate the support I’ve received to anyone who may need it on problems, concepts, or anything math-related. I am free during most G and H Blocks and am more than happy to meet/chat with anyone during lunches or unused community blocks.

But I've found that learning the concepts yourself leads to a fuller and deeper understanding in the end. If you work with me, you'll find that I ask you many questions; so many questions that you'll end up feeling like the math tutor yourself! But most importantly, I want to make math enjoyable and fun, as it is for me! Confidence is everything, and I know you can become that "math person"!

        <h3>Hi I'm Alex 🐐! I'm currently a junior in math 5. I enjoy working through problems slowly, and finding new ways to make math fun! I genuinely enjoy helping others with math, and I hope to inspire a passion for math in others :) I know math can get really tough, and certain problems can become incredibly tedious, so as a math squad member I will be there for you if you need a patient, helping hand. My free blocks are B and F, please reach out to me by email (akozlova@college-prep.org).</h3>
